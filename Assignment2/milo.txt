 In a quiet forest, a tiny squirrel named Milo loved
2 to collect shiny acorns. One day, he found a golden
3 acorn near a sparkling stream. Curious, he followed
4 a trail of glowing pebbles that led him to a hidden
5 grove. There, he met a wise old owl who shared
6 stories of the forestâ€™s magic. Milo returned home,
7 feeling grateful for the adventure and the new
8 friend he had made.
